    			I admire from a far, the strongest buzz in this bar<br>
    			I throw back a whiskey, cuz tonight I’m feeling risky<br>
    			I float across the floor, to the girl that I adore<br>
    			Take a chance with me, I will set your heart free<br>
                <br>
    			You are my Fire, the one that I desire<br>
    			You are my Fire, no one’s flame can get me higher<br>
    			You melt my soul you are my fire<br>
                <br>
    			Now baby take my hand, I’ve had about all I can stand<br>
    			This love’s ready to ignite, let me love you under the moonlight<br>
    			She smiles back at me, with a warmth that can’t be seen<br>
    			Now baby come in close, cuz my heart burns for you the most<br>
                <br>
    			You are my Fire, the one that I desire<br>
    			You are my Fire, no one’s flame can get me higher<br>
    			You melt my soul you are my fire<br>
                <br>
    			You’re lookin so good tonight, and everything about you just feels right<br>
    			Baby I can’t resist, I’ve gotta lean in for the kiss<br>
                <br>
    			You are my Fire, the one that I desire<br>
    			You are my Fire, no one’s flame can get me higher<br>
    			You are my Fire, you are my Fire<br>
    			You are my Fire, no one’s flame can get me higher<br>
    			You melt my soul, you are my Fire<br><br><br>
